# Advent of Code 2025

See [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about).

My main goal with this is to have fun with this year's challenges and gain some more practice with:
- jj (used for VCS operations in this repository);
- functional programming (where it makes sense);

I may also use this project as a sandbox to try out some crates or services I've been eyeing to play with (again, in some cases) for a while:
- Mise
- [Ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/);
